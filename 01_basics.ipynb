    "## Development of the Python Programming Language\n",
    "1. The Origin of Python\n",
    "Developer: Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, is the creator of Python.\n",
    "Inspiration: Python was inspired by the ABC programming language, which was designed for teaching and prototyping but lacked certain features like exception handling and the ability to interface with the operating system. Guido wanted to create a language that combined the strengths of ABC with more powerful and flexible capabilities. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. Initial Development\n",
    "Timeline:\n",
    "Guido began working on Python in December 1989 while at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.\n",
    "The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991.\n",
    "Features of Python 0.9.0:\n",
    "It included core concepts like exception handling, functions, and the core data types: str, list, dict, and others.\n",
    "Modules were also introduced in this version, allowing the reuse of code and modular programming.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. Naming of Python\n",
    "Guido named the language \"Python\" as a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python, not after the snake. He was reading the script for \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" while developing the language and wanted a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. Purpose of Development\n",
    "Guido wanted to create a language that was:\n",
    "Easy to Read and Write: Emphasizing code readability with clear syntax.\n",
    "High-Level: Abstracting complex details of the computer's operation.\n",
    "Flexible and Extensible: Suitable for a variety of applications, from scripting to full-scale application development.\n",
    "Interactive and Interpreted: Allowing users to quickly test and execute code.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "5. Key Milestones in Python's Evolution\n",
    "1994: Python 1.0 was released, featuring functional programming tools like lambda, map(), filter(), and reduce().\n",
    "2000: Python 2.0 was introduced, adding list comprehensions, garbage collection, and the dict constructor.\n",
    "2008: Python 3.0, a major revision, was released to rectify inconsistencies in the language and improve overall design. It was not backward compatible with Python 2.x, which led to a long period of transition and dual-version support.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "6. Community and Open Source\n",
    "Python has always been an open-source project, with contributions from a global community of developers.\n",
    "Python Software Foundation (PSF): Established in 2001, the PSF manages the open-source licensing and ongoing development of Python.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "7. Why Python Became Popular\n",
    "Simplicity and Readability: Its clean and readable syntax makes it an excellent language for beginners and professionals alike.\n",
    "Versatility: Used in various domains such as web development, data science, automation, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "Extensive Libraries and Community Support: A vast ecosystem of libraries and a supportive community help developers solve almost any problem using Python.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "8. Current Status\n",
    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide, driven by its extensive use in data science, machine learning, and web development.\n",
    "It continues to evolve with regular updates and an active community contributing to its development.\n",
    "Leadership and Governance\n",
    "Guido van Rossum served as Python's \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\" (BDFL), overseeing its development until he stepped down from the role in 2018.\n",
    "Today, Pythonâ€™s development is managed by the Python Steering Council, ensuring the language continues to grow and meet the needs of its diverse user base."

    "# 1. Encapsulation\n",
    "# 2. Abstraction\n",
    "# 3. Inheritance\n",
    "# 4. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# ==========================\n",
    "# 1. Classes and Objects\n",
    "# ==========================\n",
    "# A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.\n",

    "# Example: Creating a simple class `Car` with attributes and methods.\n",
    "class Car:\n",

    "# 7. Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "# ==========================\n",
    "# Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit from more than one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Multiple inheritance\n",
    "class Flyer:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",

    "# ==========================\n",
    "# Class methods are methods bound to the class, not the instance of the class. Static methods do not depend on class or instance attributes.\n",
